# REST-Service-Spring-Boot
Creating a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) Service with Sprint Boot

# Functionalities:
StudentController.java - Rest controller exposing all the three service methods discussed above.
Course.java, Student.java, StudentService.java - Business Logic for the application. StudentService exposes a couple of methods we would consume from our Rest Controller.
StudentControllerIT.java - Integration Tests for the Rest Services.
StudentControllerTest.java - Unit Tests for the Rest Services.
StudentServicesApplication.java - Launcher for the Spring Boot Application. To run the application, just launch this file as Java Application.
pom.xml - Contains all the dependencies needed to build this project. We will use Spring Boot Starter Web.
